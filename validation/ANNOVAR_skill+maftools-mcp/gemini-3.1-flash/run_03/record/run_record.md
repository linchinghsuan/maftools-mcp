# Run Record — Gemini 3.1 Flash, run_03

## Run context
- **Model:** Gemini 3.1 Flash
- **Run:** run_03
- **Agent/client:** OpenCode v1.18.31
- **Access method:** OpenRouter
- **Input cohort:** 50 VCF files from `VCFs/` (20,963 input variant records).

## ANNOVAR annotation code and evidence
- **Reference build / annotation:** hg19 / refGene, gene-based operation (`g`) where supported by the retained records.
- **Annotation result:** Pass — 50/50 ANNOVAR annotations succeeded; 20,963 multianno rows
- **Command evidence:**
- No exact per-run ANNOVAR command script was found in the retained run files. The reference configuration is hg19/refGene, gene-based annotation; additional flags are not inferred.
- Exact invocation details are available in the linked script/log where present. If no command source is listed above, the original exact command was not retained and has not been guessed.

## Workflow and Maftools-MCP tool calls
- **Expected workflow:** VCF → ANNOVAR skill → annotated VCF → merge_annovar_to_maf → plot_oncoplot → export_r_script
- **Observed workflow/tool-call sequence:** VCF → ANNOVAR skill → annotated VCF → merge_annovar_to_maf → plot_oncoplot → get_gene_summary → get_sample_summary → export_r_script ×2
- **Workflow agreement:** Compatible
